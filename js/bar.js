// Create axes and scales

// x axis will be year, y axis will be number of wins

// We will use HW4 and HW5 code as reference since we would like to make interactive code for this section

// Allow filtering by team so we can see which teams have had the most success over time

// opted for bar chart instead of line chart since wins are a discrete value
