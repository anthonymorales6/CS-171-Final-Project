This project takes a dive into the success of the San Antonio Spurs, namely:

1. Notable personnel
2. Analysis of metrics that contributed to said success
3. Comparison against other teams over given time period

We chose the San Antonio Spurs because they have been the model of success for this millenium. Other teams, such as the Golden State Warriors,
have adopted some aspects of the Spurs organization which have led to multiple championships. These aspects include, but are not limited to, a defensive minded gameplan,
cultivation of roster through drafting players, and a consistent head coach who is evidently respected by his players. Additionally, the Spurs are a very underappreciated team,
so we felt it necessary to explore their history. 

For the technical aspect of this project, we referenced labs/homeworks from throughout the semester and used online resources, such as stackoverflow and d3graphgallery to look for ideas
and help on implementation of some more complex visualizations. We employed d3 and bootstrap to bolster the interactivity and presentation of our website. Most of our graphs are interactive, and we made sure to include a notice so our users know when there is more information to uncover. We hope you enjoy this project as much as we enjoyed implementing it; our team
felt that it shed some light on the effective yet understated way the Spurs play basketball.
