                <p id="scatter1text">Since beating the New York Knicks in the 1999 NBA Finals,
                    the San Antonio Spurs have amassed a regular season record of 969-383.
                    Since then, they have made the Western Conference finals eight times,
                    advanced to the NBA Finals five times, and won four more NBA championships.
                    No other team in the NBA has had nearly as impressive a stretch, yet San Antonio
                    remains one of the most underappreciated teams in all of professional sports.
                    As a result, we want to explore the key factors behind their
                    outstanding success.

            <p>Gregg Popovich took the reigns of the Spurs organization at the start of the 1996-1997 season.
                Only two short seasons later, the team, headlined by a Tim Duncan and David Robinson frontcourt, was able to claim the coveted Larry O'Brien Trophy for the first time.
                Popovich's basketball expertise permeates outside of the basketball court, serving as a key piece in personnel decision-making.
                He is said to have heavily influenced the selections of Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili, two role players that excelled at their positions in the 2005, 2007, and 2014. Moreover, he pushed for the
                draft night move that landed the Spurs future 2014-2015/2015-2016 Defensive Player of the Year and 2013-2014 Finals MVP, Kawhi Leonard, who is highly regarded as one of the best two-way players in the league.
                San Antonio was never a flashy free agent destination, yet their play is on par with that of a superteam; their systematic and patient way of playing the game is what contributed to their success in the 2000's.
                In order to achieve such dynastic prowess, it is essential to have a full roster that "buys in." History tells us, Pop did just that.</p>
